                    </p>
                    Diego Armando Maradona was born at 5 am on Sunday, October 30, 1960 in the Evita clinic in the city of Lanus, which is located in the province of Buenos Aires. He was born in the family of Don Diego, a hereditary worker who worked at the Tritumol mill, and his wife, the housewife Dalma Salvadora Franco. Maradona was the fifth child in the family, but the first boy: before him were born four sisters-Rita, Ana, Elsa and Maria. Later, the Dalma of Salvador said: "It was easier for me than others. On Saturday, I felt fine all day, and at night I was taken to the clinic. He was born very quickly. At that moment, I only prayed for one thing: that I would be born healthy and become a good person. All this, fortunately, seems to have come true, and even I would say, with a vengeance."
                    </p>
                    <p>According to the results of the research of Narciso Binagnan, disputed, according to the author of the study, by many experts in the field of genealogy, the roots of the Maradona family came from Italy, in particular, he is a descendant of Marco Polo. Diego also has Croatian roots: Salvadora's grandmother in her maiden name was named Kariolich, and her father was a native of the island of Korcula.</p>
                    <p>At the age of 10 months, Diego learned to walk. Like most children in Argentina, Maradona started chasing the ball from an early age. What the children played was hardly football, the kids just ran around and hit the ball.</p>
                    When Maradona was 7 years old, his cousin Beto, the son of Aunt Nena, gave him the very first ball in his life. Diego was so happy with the gift that he fell asleep with it in his arms on the first night. Diego then took the ball outside to show it off in front of the court, but, deciding not to give the ball to anyone, took it home. The ball had been in Diego's room all winter, and only occasionally had he chased it around the house with his sisters. In the spring, Diego still decided to take him out into the yard: his father showed him how to hit, and his son trained for a long time against the wall, simply striking with his left foot.</p>
                    When Diego learned to hit the ball well after training, he started playing full-fledged football with the older guys. In the game, little Diego did not succeed, the older players skipped past or circled him, and the offended Maradona grabbed the ball with his hands and pressed it to himself. Gradually, Maradona got used to football and began to play like everyone else on the field. He could play for hours on a vacant lot called "Seven Glades", where yard matches were held. Diego preferred to play in the position of libero, only at a later age he switched to the attack. Gradually, Maradona became one of the most technical players in the yard, and the school teams always wanted Diego to play for them. After Maradona went to the school "Remedios de Escalada San Martin", he was almost immediately included in the football team of the Escalada, where the younger students played. In 1999, in his book, Diego wrote: "I always say that I became a professional, starting from a very young age: I played for the team that invited me first, sometimes I was not allowed to leave the house, and then I roared like crazy. Still, five minutes before our match started, Tota always gave me permission. But it took a lot more effort to convince Don Diego, my father. I understood my old man, and how could I not understand him when he was literally struggling to eat and learn? And he really wanted me to learn."</p>
                    <p>Diego's family lived in the Villa Fiorito neighborhood at the intersection of Asamor and Mario Bravo streets in a three-room house that was located on the southern outskirts of Buenos Aires and was one of the poorest in the city. Maradona's family was also in poverty, so the children, to help their parents, made clay jars for flowers, sold them at the local market and gave all the money they earned to their mother. Diego did it, too. He later said, " If my parents ask me for the moon, I will do everything I can to get it. But that would be nothing compared to what they did for me."</p>

                    When Maradona was 8 years old, he met Goyo Carrizo, a 10-year-old boy who played in the children's team of the club "Argentinos Juniors". Carrizo was very fond of football, and on this basis the guys became friends — the more experienced Carrizo told Maradona about the great football players of the past, in which Maradona was interested.</p>
                    < p>Carrizo, in mid-1969, introduced Maradona to Francisco Cornejo, a scout for Argentinos Juniors and coach of the under-14 team. At the first viewing of the team, Diego played so well that Cornejo did not believe in the age of Maradona, thinking that he was a dwarf. Cornejo invited Maradona to attend the training sessions of the club's adult team, where Diego, like other young players, served balls to the players. From these guys, Cornejo created the team "Los Cebolitas" ("Onions"), which was the youth team of "Argentinos Juniors". He provided them with uniforms and a field where regular training sessions were held. The team was quite strong: young players beat all the local youth teams. The leader of the "Onions" was Maradona, who had excellent technique, the ability to make the right decisions on the field and excellent physical form, thanks to which he could run both halves almost without getting tired. Another valuable quality of Diego was that after hitting his legs, he did not fall. Francisco Cornejo said: "Even then, Diego Maradona could do almost everything with the ball. He was like a wooden doll-a tumbler: no matter how much you push him, he always stays on his feet." At the same time, Diego was three years younger than the rest of the team.</p>
                    <p>With each match, the "Onions" progressed, regular victories with a double-digit score became regular. The apotheosis of their game was the match held on September 28, 1971, in which Maradona's team defeated the youth team of River Plate with a score of 7:1. In this game, Diego, who was only 10 years old at the time, scored 5 goals. At the same time, before the start of the game, he promised his injured teammate that he would score 2 goals for himself and three for him: "On the field, we were like a car. We beat everyone even with a score of 20: 0. We dreamed of playing against the famous juniors from River Plate, who were the champions of Argentina. Finally, this match took place. We won 7: 1, and I scored an amazing goal, and I scored five goals in total, as promised. You should have seen how angry the opponent was and chased me all over the field." Since that match, Maradona has been talked about as a future star of Argentine football, and the newspaper Clarín wrote an article about Diego, in which it mistakenly called him Caradona. The team played so hard that it reached a record of 136 consecutive games without defeat. Before the game with the youth team of Banfield, Diego seriously injured his hand, he had seven stitches, Cornejo did not want to let him out on the field, but Maradona persuaded the coach and was able to play in the match, where he scored 5 goals, and his club won 7:1. Along with performances in domestic competitions, the team participated in tournaments in Peru and in Uruguay. In addition to playing for the "Bulblets" Maradona played at halftime "Argentinos juniors", cutting the ball. For this skill, he was called to the television program "Sabados Circulares".</p>
                    < p>From the age of 12, Maradona played for the youth team of Argentinos Juniors. In order for Diego to play for Juniors, the head coach of the team was forced to hide the age of Diego, which was below the minimum allowed. Therefore, Maradona played for the "Red Beetles" under a false name. In 1973, the youth team of "Argentinos" won the final of the Evita Cup "River Plate" with a score of 5: 4, in this game Maradona scored a goal, beating seven people. A week after the game, William Keith, who was the president of the River Plate, offered Diego's father to buy Maradona, but he refused. The following year, the team won the championship of the ninth league of Argentina, entering the eighth league. In 1975, the club achieved a gap of 10 points from the nearest pursuer in the championship, and Diego was sent to the seventh team "Argentinos". In the seventh team, he played only two games, and he was immediately transferred to the fifth team. In the fifth team, Maradona played 4 matches and was transferred to the third team. In the third team, Diego played three games. After that, Maradona was transferred to the main squad of Argentinos Juniors.</p>
                    Despite these achievements, Maradona's family was still poor. Diego had brothers Raul and Ugo, and then a sister Claudia. The father encouraged his son's passion, taking him to the club for training every day after work, hoping that he could become a famous football player and lead the family out of poverty:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                         "My father continued to work at the mill. He always came home from work tired. He worked two shifts, morning and evening. Grain was brought almost round the clock, and fresh grinding was immediately returned to the owner. However, in the afternoon, after dinner, he would take me by the hand and take me to the club..."</p>

                    <p><strong>1976</strong></p>
                    On October 20, 1976, 10 days before his 16th birthday, Maradona made his debut in the main squad of Argentinos Juniors, coming 10 minutes before the end of the match at number 16 in the match of the championship of Argentina. Despite the fact that the "Red bugs" lost the match club "Talleres", Maradona immediately showed itself, making several passes and also set up a goal, not implemented Jorge Lopez, after which the defender "Talleres" Juan Cabrera was charged with coaching benches personally to take care of a 16-year-old footballer. On the evening after the match, Maradona said: "On this day, I touched the sky with my hands." After the game, Maradona received even a small fee, but the biggest reward was the respect of the fans, as well as press reviews:<br>Maradona, a young player who will turn sixteen in ten days, stepped up his attack at the end of the match. His ability to control the ball stands out even against the background of the players from Cordoba, who are rightly considered the best "techies" in Argentine football. However, even this dodger failed to ram the iron defense of the "Talleres", and "Argentinos" was forced to concede 0: 1.</p>
                    <p>In the next game with the club "Newells Old Boys" Maradona was in the starting line-up. However, the match was unsuccessful for both Maradona and the club, who lost 2:4. After that, the young player was sent to play for the second team of Juniors for several months. Only on November 14, he again appeared on the field in the match of the foundation with the club "San Lorenzo", replacing Giacobetti at the end of the second half. And here Maradona showed his talent, scoring two goals in a short time. After this match, Diego has already become the basis player of the "Red Beetles", having played 11 matches and scored 2 goals. The press spoke positively about the young footballer's game, but he himself said that he still has a lot to learn.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>
                         <strong>1977 and 1978</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>In 1977, Cesar Luis Menotti, the head coach of the Argentine national team, called Maradona to a friendly match with the Hungarian national team, held on February 27. Maradona came on 20 minutes before the end of the match, replacing Leopoldo Luque, but did not show anything special. Diego himself was dissatisfied with his performance in this match. The challenge was unexpected: by that time, Maradona had played only 12 games for the Juniors ' main squad.
                    <p>In February (when I was sixteen years old) I made my debut for the national team in a game at the familiar Boca Juniors stadium against the Hungarian national team. I was invited by Menotti himself. He called me on the phone: "Maradona, Maradona, is that you? — What is it? " he asked twice. — I included you in the squad for the game with the Hungarians. Are you coming?"» Menotti was being sly when he asked that question. He knew that if he called any Argentine football player to the national team, he would immediately rush to the training camp.</p>
                    <p>On April 3 of the same year, Maradona made his debut with the youth national team of Argentina, with which he played at the youth Championship of South America, held in the same year in Venezuela. There, Diego played all 3 matches of the national team. For the Red Beetles, Maradona also had a good season, playing in 49 games and scoring 19 goals. Leading South American and European clubs began to "hunt" for the young Argentine talent, but Diego refused everyone, preferring to prepare for the World Cup in a calm atmosphere, for a trip where Maradona was one of the candidates.</p>
                    <p>But Diego did not go to the World Cup: 13 days before the start of the tournament, he became the last excluded from the preliminary application of the national team. The announcement sent young Diego into a fit of hysteria. Three days later, he even called Menotti at home and begged him to let him go to the World Cup, but he refused. Maradona said:</p><blockquote>
                         <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "It was the biggest upset in my life. Being in great shape, burning with the desire to play for your team and be out of work-you can't survive this."</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>I never forgave Menotti and I never will — I still think he missed his chance — but I never hated him. Hating is not the same as not forgiving. It was terrible at home. It was like a funeral. My mother was crying, my father was crying, my brothers and sisters were crying. They told me that I was the best, that I had nothing to worry about, because I would have time to play in five more championships. But they were all crying. And that was the worst part. On that saddest day of my career, I swore I would take it. With my feet, my heart, and my thoughts, I felt that I would show them all again. I will play in many more world championships.</p>
                    <p>A possible reason for not inviting Maradona to the tournament was that Menotti did not like his extremely explosive nature. The head coach called him a "savage" and accused him of giving interviews only for money, on the advice of his impresario. Another reason was that the team leader Daniel Passarella did not want to see young players in the squad, and especially Diego. Returning to Argentinos from the national team, Maradona played a match with the club "Chacarita Juniors", where he scored 2 goals and made 2 assists; his club won the match 5-0. In total, Maradona scored 25 goals in 35 matches, including 22 goals in Metropolitano, becoming the top scorer of the championship. After the World Cup, where Argentina won its first ever title, Menotti called up several players of the youth team to the camp of the main Argentine team, among whom was Maradona. In the National Championship of Argentina, Maradona played 4 games and scored 4 goals in them.<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>In 1979, Maradona participated in the youth team at the South American Championship. There, the Argentines took second place, losing only to the hosts of the tournament, the national team of Uruguay. At the tournament, Diego played 5 of his team's 6 games. In the same year, as the team captain, he went to the World Youth Championship in Japan. He made his debut in the championship on August 26 in a match against Indonesia, which the Argentines won 5-0, and Diego scored two goals. At the tournament, the Argentines won all the matches, conceding only 2 goals, becoming the best team in the world, and Maradona himself, who did not play only in the 1/4 final with Algeria, was recognized as the best player of the championship and scored in each of the matches played, except for the match with Yugoslavia. In addition, in the final with the USSR national team, Maradona scored the last goal of the match, which finally "confirmed" the score in the game. According to Diego, the youth team of the 1979 model was the best team in his entire career, in which he played.</p>
                    <p>At the club level, Maradona became the top scorer of Metropolitano and Nacional, scoring 14 and 12 goals, respectively, with Argentinos Juniors. At the end of a season in which his club did not perform well, Maradona was recognized as the Best Player and best athlete of Argentina, scoring a total of 26 goals in 27 matches played. As a member of the Argentina national team in 1979, Diego scored the first goal, striking against Scotland in a friendly game on 2 June. In the same year, he, as part of the national team, went to the Copa America, where he played 2 games and scored 1 goal, hitting the gates of Bolivia. In this tournament "Albiceleste" was unsuccessful, finishing in last place in their group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>1980</strong></p>
                    <p>The following year, Maradona was again the top scorer of both Argentine championships with 25 and 18 goals, which allowed him to become the only player in the history of the Argentine championship, 5 times becoming the top scorer of the national championships. Diego's goals helped his club finish second in the Metropolitano. On September 14, Maradona scored his hundredth goal at the professional level, hitting the goal of San Lorenzo. However, too much media attention and Diego's constant absences from the national team had a bad effect on the attitude of the club towards Maradona. At Argentinos Juniors, half of the players did not communicate with Diego, and the club's coach demanded goals first in every match, and then in every half. In October, on the eve of the club's match with Boca Juniors, Boca goalkeeper Hugo Orlando Gatti said in an interview that Maradona is not a bad player, but the media inflate his importance too much, and also called Diego "fat". In response, Maradona in the press called Gatti envious and said that he concedes "stupid goals". Before the game, Gatti approached Diego and said that he had not said anything like that, but he did not care: Maradona, angry with the goalkeeper's words, scored 4 goals. Many people recognize that match as the best game of Diego in the "Argentinos Juniors". After the game, Maradona expected approval from the club's management, but instead of praise, he was told :" For you, this is the norm. You get paid for goals." After that, Maradona stopped going to training and began to look for a new club. The candidate to buy Maradona was River Plate, who offered Diego a salary equal to that of the team's highest-paid player, Ubaldo Fillol. But Maradona did not want to move to River: in an interview, he said that he was invited by Boca Juniors, although this was not true. After these words, Boca began negotiations on the transfer of the striker. On February 20, Maradona became a Boca Juniors player. This transition was called the "transfer of the century". Diego moved to the camp of the "Genoese" on loan with the gradual purchase of the contract of the player by the club for a total of 3 million 600 thousand dollars. This money was paid by Boca for a year and a half. Under the contract, the "Genoese" had to pay 600 thousand dollars of "lifting" to Maradona himself, but due to the team's problems with finances, the club instead of money gave Diego two apartments in the houses of businessman Tito Gurovich, in the districts of Correia y Libertador and Republica de la India.</p>

                    <p>With Boka, Maradona signed one of the most financially lucrative contracts in Argentine football — he was paid 15 salaries of 60 thousand dollars a year, as well as 10 thousand for each exhibition match. The club also insured Diego-in the event of an injury, Boca would have received 500 thousand dollars. This transition changed not only the life of the football player, but also the life of his family, who moved to a new spacious house. On the day of signing the contract, Diego played in a friendly match between Argentinos Juniors and Boca Juniors, playing in each team's half and scoring a goal for Boca from the penalty spot.</p>
                    <p>The official debut of Maradona in the "Genoese" took place on February 22. In the match against Boca's rival, Talleres, Maradona's club won 4-1, and Diego himself scored 2 goals. At the same time, he left the game with an injury that he received while playing for Argentinos Juniors: he had sore muscles in his right leg. Despite the pain, Diego continued to play for the club until March 8, when he was found to have a tear in the muscle tissue of his thigh, due to which he had to withdraw from playing until March 29. On April 10, a few days after recovering from his injury, Maradona played in his first Superclasico, a classic match between Boka and River Plate. The game was played at the Bombonera; Boquita won 3-0, and Maradona scored one of his team's 3 goals (the other two were scored by Brindisi), beating Fillol and Tarantini.</p>
                    <p>In the same 1981, Maradona had a conflict with the head coach Silvio Marsolini, who did not give the freedom in the game that the forward had in "Argentinos". In addition, Marsolini was a very demanding mentor in everything related to discipline and training, which Diego did not like. According to Maradona, Marsolini was afraid that Diego could get out of control. In addition, the team suffered from the fan group "12", which, after 4 consecutive games without a win, broke into the team's base with a weapon, demanding better results.</p>
                    <p>Maradona won the Metropolitano tournament with Boca, drawing 1-1 with Racing in the last round; Diego scored the goal in this game, after converting a penalty. After the game with River Plate, the main rival of the "Genoese" secretly offered Maradona a super-profitable contract, but he refused. Boca's tournament National was unsuccessful: the club lost in the 1/4 final to Velez Sarsfield, while Maradona was sent off in the first game with this team, and did not participate in the second due to disqualification caused by the removal. The match against Velez was Maradona's last for Boca in the Argentine league during his first stint at the club. The loss was attributed to the large number of friendly matches played by the team, which Boca was forced to play due to the club's unsatisfactory financial situation. After one of the defeats, Pablo Abbatangelo, a member of the club's board of directors, came into the locker room of Boca, he hinted that the players do not fully give their best on the football field. To this, Diego, on the air of the TV program "60 minutes", called Abbatangelo a fool. In the national team, Diego played some good matches in Europe and South America, but a little later, due to too tight a schedule of games, he missed several training sessions, and Menotti dropped him from the team. After a negative assessment of this event in the press, the football player and the coach reconciled, although they did not communicate anywhere else except on the field.</p>
                    <p>In the winter of 1982, Maradona played his last games for Boquita at the Verano tournament, as he had to concentrate on preparing for the World Cup in Spain. The last match in the "Boca Juniors" football player played on February 6, 1982 with "River Plate", and in it "Boca" was defeated. In total, he played 40 matches for the club and scored 28 goals.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>World Cup 1982</strong></p>
                    <p>Argentina's preparation for the World Cup took 4 months. The whole of Argentina, inspired by the victory of the national team at the last World Cup and the success of the youth team in 1979, demanded that the team win. The championship for Argentina started on June 13 in a match against Belgium; in this game, the Argentines were defeated with a score of 0: 1. This match was the first for Diego at the World Championships. In it, he hit the crossbar with a free kick. In the second game, Argentina beat Hungary 4-1; Maradona was the best on the field and scored twice, in the 28th and 57th minutes. In Game 3, Argentina beat El Salvador 2-0 and advanced to the second round from 2nd place.</p>
                    <p>The second round also consisted of a group stage, in which there were 12 teams that made up 4 groups, the winners of the groups went to the semifinals, the remaining teams finished their performances. Argentina was placed in Group 3, along with Italy and Brazil. In the first match of the second group tournament, Argentina met with Italy and lost 1:2. Against Maradona, Claudio Gentile personally acted, coping with the guardianship of the Argentine, except for the case when Diego hit the crossbar. According to some experts, the main referee of the match should have removed Claudio, who acted very harshly with the Argentine, who insulted the defender throughout the game: "Maradona insulted me, my mother and generally told me everything." In the second match, Argentina lost to Brazil 1: 3, and Maradona, who was the most active member of the "Albicelesta", was removed in the 85th minute from the field after hitting Batista. Thus, Argentina did not meet the expectations placed on it before the tournament.</p>
                    <p>One of the reasons for the poor performance is the close attention from the defenders, who played hard and sometimes rough against Diego. It was because of this that Maradona was sent off in the last game against Brazil, when he hit Batista, who violated the rules against him. According to Diego, the reason for the poor performance of the team was the poor physical preparation of the national team, which was very intense, as a result, the Argentine players came to the tournament very tired.</p>
                    <p>He was beaten so badly that I was afraid he would be killed altogether. In Spain, Maradona was already a star, and against every star they always play very carefully, hard, sometimes rough. Maybe he didn't have the experience then. It was his first time competing at a World Championship. And, of course, I did not expect that they would play so evil against him, and psychologically I was not ready for this. The Italians were especially tough on him, and their player Gentile played against Maradona just brutally. Rinat Dasaev about Maradona at the World Championship in 1982.</p>

                    <p>In 1982, Maradona moved to the Catalan "Barcelona", which paid Diego himself 3 million dollars of "lifting" and 200 thousand dollars a year as a salary; the contract was signed for 6 years. The transfer amount was 1.2 billion pesetas ($8 million), with 66% of this amount going to Argentinos Juniors and the rest to Boke Juniors. This transfer was the most expensive in the history of football at that time.</p>
                    <p>Catalonia welcomed Maradona as a real football star: all the newspapers published a report on the arrival of Diego on the front pages. His debut game was a match on 4 September 1982 against Valencia, in which Barca lost 1:2. After the first matches, the player became a real idol of the Spanish public, and often local commentators, describing the successful individual actions of the players, said: "he played like Maradona." He made 15 appearances in the Spanish league and scored 6 goals before being diagnosed with hepatitis in December. Because of this disease, Maradona was left without football for 3 months. Without Maradona, Barcelona played 14 league games and several Cup games, where they were eliminated in the 1/4 finals.</p>
                    <p>On March 12, 1983, Maradona returned to the field in a match against Betis. In this match, Barcelona were led for the first time by the new head coach of Barcelona and Maradona's former mentor in the national team of Argentina, Cesar Luis Menotti. His arrival on the coaching bridge of the "blue-garnet" Diego supported: the former head coach of the club, Udo Lattek, was engaged in training exclusively running endurance exercises, which did not like Maradona at all. In the second game after his return, Diego scored three goals against Las Palmas. Shortly after the recovery of Maradona and the appointment of Menotti as head coach of Barcelona, the club achieved victory in the Spanish Cup. In his first season in Europe, Maradona made 35 appearances and scored 23 goals. In the championship, Barca finished fourth. In the same season, Diego helped his club win the Spanish League Cup, where he scored a goal in each of the two matches against the opponent, Real Madrid»; at the same time, the goal scored at the Santiago Bernabeu caused an ovation from the fans of Real Madrid, who appreciated the beauty of the moment when Maradona, having beaten two defenders and a goalkeeper, paused, as a result of which the defender of the "Royal Club" crashed into the post, and only after that scored a goal.</p>

                    <p><strong>1983/1984</strong></p>
                    <p>The 1983/1984 season started poorly for Maradona. On September 24, 1983, Barcelona met in the 4th round of the Spanish championship with Athletic club; in this game, which Barca won 4-0, the player received a very serious injury: Athletic player Andoni Goicoechea, who had been hitting Diego on the legs for the entire match, broke his ankle in the 59th minute of the match and caused a number of minor injuries. Because of this episode, a fight broke out on the field, in which all the representatives of the teams took part. Maradona was operated on in the Barcelona clinic by Dr. Gonzalez Adrio, who said that Diego will be able to return to the field only after 6 months. Diego then underwent a period of rehabilitation with a sports medic, Ruben Dario Oliva. Thanks to the course of treatment of this doctor, on January 8, 1984, in a match with Sevilla, Maradona returned to the field, and, making two assists, helped his club win 3-1. Despite the successful return, after several unimpressive matches, the audience, who remembered the game before the injury, began to boo him, in response to this, Diego shook his fist at her, which was very much not liked by the fans of the "blue-garnet". In total, in the 1983/1984 season, Diego played 23 matches and scored 15 goals, and Barcelona took only 3rd place in the championship.</p>
                    <p>Barca also reached the final of the Spanish Cup, where they faced Athletic, who became the champion of Spain, with Goicoechea in the squad, and lost 0: 1. Immediately after the game, Maradona attacked Athletic player Sola with his fists, as a result, a fight broke out on the field with the participation of almost all the players of the teams. After the game, several players of both clubs were disqualified, Maradona as one of the instigators of the fight was disqualified for 3 months.</p>
                    <p>In addition to Maradona's football performances, the press paid a lot of attention to his salary and behavior outside of football. In addition, the president of the team, Josep Nunes, criticized his player for frequent visits to nightclubs, which made Diego very angry. On one occasion, Nunes even took Maradona's passport to prevent him from going to Paul Breitner's farewell match. Diego's passport was returned only when he came to the club's office, where he made a scandal and broke the Teresa Herrera Cup. But Maradona was not released for Breitner's farewell match. Due to all these circumstances, injuries, illnesses and misunderstanding with Nunes, Maradona, after consulting with his common-law wife Claudia, decided to leave Barcelona. Diego was even willing to buy out his contract from the club. Soon the Catalan team received an offer from Italy: the club "Napoli" offered to buy the transfer of the player.</p>
                    <p>In just two seasons at Barcelona, Maradona made 58 appearances and scored 38 goals. In 1999, in honor of the centenary of Barca, a poll among fans was conducted on Catalan television, according to which Maradona is the third player in the history of the club; he was beaten only by Ladislav Kubala and Johan Cruyff. Despite a generally good performance in the blue-garnet squad, Maradona later said that the move to Barcelona was a mistake.</p>

                         On June 29, 1984, former football player and then manager of the club "Napoli" Antonio Iuliano began negotiations with" Barcelona " for the transfer of Maradona. And the next day the deal was made, the clubs agreed on a transfer in the amount of 14 billion liras (about 7.6 million dollars), the largest at that time paid by football clubs for the transfer of a player, and 800 thousand to Maradona himself, who signed a contract until June 1989.

                    <p>On Maradona's first flight to Naples, he was greeted by a huge crowd of fans. Fans of the club lifted Maradona in their arms and carried him to the city. On July 5, the official presentation of Maradona as a player of "Napoli"took place. It took place at the San Paolo Stadium, where 70,000 spectators gathered to see the new player, who, standing in a white T-shirt and blue trousers (the official colors of Napoli), first uttered his first words in Italian: "Good evening, residents of Naples, I am happy to be with you", and then made a circle of honor, greeting the fans in all the stands: "It was an unforgettable reception and an unforgettable day for me. It was like opening a new page in my biography, and at the same time opening up a new world for me."</p>

                    < p>Maradona made his debut for Napoli on 16 September, in an away match against Verona, which ended with a score of 1:3. In the second game of the Azzurri, Maradona hit the goal of the Sampdoria club and first of all took the ball out of the net and kissed it, which later became a tradition — this is how Maradona celebrated all his balls. On November 19, in the 84th minute of the away match with Ascoli, with the score 1:1, Maradona received his first red card in the Neapolitan club. He pushed the football player" white-black " Enrico Nicolini, who after this episode fell on the lawn, clutching his face, as a result, both players were removed from the field. In general, in the first season with Maradona, "Napoli" did not play very well: in the middle of the season, the club was even in the relegation zone from Serie A, but after a series of successful matches, the Neapolitan team straightened out the situation and took 8th place. That season, Maradona scored 14 goals, the most in a team that scored a total of 34 goals. At the end of the season, Maradona said that this was his first victory in Italy.</p>

The last two got into the team on the recommendation of Maradona. The club finished in 3rd place in the league, and also won the home game of Juventus (who lost in that championship only three times) thanks to a single goal by Maradona. In the same year, Maradona scored one of his most famous goals, hitting the goal of Verona, the champion of the previous season: throwing the ball into the air, Maradona shot from 40 meters, throwing the goalkeeper of the Verona team Giuliano Giuliani who went far out of the goal.</p>

                         Maradona has not played for the Argentina national team since the 1982 World Cup. In 1983, the Argentine national team was led by Carlos Bilardo. His first step was the appointment of Diego as captain of the team, for which he personally came to Spain: "Captain of the national team. Something I've always dreamed of. To represent all the Argentine players — yes, all of them. In all the interviews, I have said that I want to finish my career as captain of the Argentina national team." Initially, the new coach of the Argentines wanted to create a team only from the players of the national championship, and call Diego only for the final games. However, he soon changed his mind and invited Maradona to a friendly match on May 10, 1985 with Paraguay, which ended in a 1-1 draw; in this game, Diego scored the only goal for the Argentines.
                    </p>
                    <p>The qualifying stage for the World Cup consisted of a group tournament. The group that included Argentina also included Venezuela, Colombia and Peru. The Argentines started with a match against Venezuela in San Cristobal, during the arrival there, one of the Venezuelans ran up to Diego and kicked him on the right knee, which caused Maradona to lie with ice on his leg all night, but then went out to the match and scored two goals, and his team won 3: 2. Then followed a series of 3 wins, which ended in a 0:1 defeat to Peru. In the last game, with the same Peru, Argentina drew 2-2 and reached the final part of the World Cup.</p>

                    <p>After this series of games, Bilardo decided to " put " the game of the Argentines around Maradona. This was not easy for him, Bilardo was criticized by everyone, even the president of the country, mainly for abandoning the traditions of Argentine football and closing the "door" to the national team to veterans. It came to the point that a decision was being prepared to remove Bilardo from the post of coach of the national team, and only after the intervention of Maradona, who said "if Bilardo leaves, I will also leave", the decision was canceled. To build the game around Diego Bilardo personally came to Italy, where he played Maradona: "I could send Maradona an official invitation to the national team by mail and a ticket to Mexico City, but then I would get someone else's" Italian“ Maradona, and I needed a real Argentine, who was passionate about my idea, a player of my team." During a personal conversation with Maradona, Bilardo said it would be his championship and offered him the captain's armband. He told Maradona that his place is not in the center of the field, but behind the backs of the attackers, where he can develop attacks in any direction. But all this Bilardo promised with one condition: Maradona will forget about everything, about all his hobbies and habits for 30 days for the sake of football. Bilardo even asked Maradona to swear that he would not break the regime: "Before I became captain, it was important for me to show what I can do in the game. Now the main thing is the whole team's game." Bilardo himself had full confidence in Diego: in particular, he did not take Ramon Diaz, who was in conflict with Maradona, into the national team at his request; Diego himself denied these accusations, saying that he himself asked Bilardo to take Diaz, but he refused.</p>
                    <p>Many of the national team's players, notably Daniel Passarella, the team's only 1978 world champion, were opposed to handing over the captaincy to Maradona, as were some football federation officials. Passarella himself believed that he should become the captain of the national team. It got to the point that when Daniel got an upset stomach, he did not take medication, fearing that Maradona would drug him. After the match with Atletico Junior, Maradona and Passarella had a quarrel, which resulted in mutual accusations. However, after Diego revealed that Passarella was dating the wife of one of the national team players, the entire team sided with Maradona. Passarella left the camp of the national team, although he remained in the national team's bid for the World Championship.</p>
                    <p>Maradona began training for the World Cup at the Rome Institute of Sports under the guidance of Professor Antonio del Monte, a specialist in the adaptation of athletes to the highlands, who worked with Maradona at the request of Bilardo. For 5 weeks, on Mondays, Diego went to Del Monte, where he took tests, and on the other days he conducted endurance training.</p>
                    <p>I didn't work on Maradona, I worked with Maradona. Moreover, virtually the entire faculty took part in this work. And Maradona was not a passive client, but an active, interested participant in this work, a person who seeks to learn as much as possible about himself. This is a very sensitive person, with a fine nervous activity and a sharp mind. And I would also note the obsession, dedication to my favorite business-football. Even then, it seemed to me that Maradona alone could defeat everyone. Perseverance, will, and patience had done their work. I believed in the abilities of this young man. His low center of gravity and strong legs made him a hero on the football field. The elasticity of the muscles, the power of the muscles were successfully combined with excellent reaction and extraordinary endurance. In physical terms, it can be compared to Apollo. Morally, it is a Gadfly, a person who is always ready to fight for victory. Any team needs such an athlete. His little legs are a wonderful mechanism. The Maradona looks like a car with a powerful engine and small wheels. Such a car gains acceleration earlier than others. Nature has given him the ability to quickly tense and relax his muscles, instantly change the direction of movement. While training on a soccer field in Mexico, my colleagues and I followed all his movements with a chronometer, and it was clear that his body was acting like a perfect machine. Not a single player who participated in the championship, even from the Mexicans who were used to the height, could surpass him either in skill or in sports form.</p>
                    <p>During the preparation, Maradona devoted all his time to football, did not go to parties, even avoided meetings with friends. According to the schedule, he got up at 8 and went to bed at 10, and also performed the daily captain's ritual: before going to bed, he went around his teammates and wished them good night, believing that the captain should be the soul of the team.</p>

                    <p>Just before the final tournament, Maradona said: "This championship will be mine!". The first match of the national team of Argentina was held in Mexico City. Initially, the Argentine football players rested more than they trained, they visited local museums, rode camels, gradually acclimating to the highlands. The game took place on June 2, in which Argentina easily beat South Korea with a score of 3:1. After the match, Diego accused FIFA of not taking enough care of the technical players and that the games started at 12 o'clock in the afternoon, when it was very hot. In the second game, the Argentines faced Italy, the world champion. The score was opened by the Italians, but in the 34th minute Maradona scored a return goal, which Diego himself called one of the best goals of his career; as a result, the game ended in a draw.:1. In the third game, Argentina defeated Bulgaria with a score of 2: 0 (Maradona made an assist) and advanced to the 1/8 finals. In the 1/8 final, Argentina met with Uruguay, the match was held on June 16 in the city of Puebla. In this game, Argentina won 1-0, thanks to a goal by Pedro Pasculli. This victory was the first won by Argentina over Uruguay in the final parts of the World Cups.</p>

                         In the 1/4 final, Argentina met with England. The game had not only a sports subtext: 4 years before the World Cup, Argentina and Great Britain fought for the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), because of which there were clashes between fans who remembered these events in the stands and outside. The match was played on June 22 at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. In the 51st minute, Maradona opened the scoring. Steve Hodge unsuccessfully hit the ball to his goalkeeper Peter Shilton, and Maradona, who was inferior to the goalkeeper in height of 20 cm, with his left hand, ahead of the goalkeeper, scored it into the goal. The referee of the match did not record any violations of the rules. This goal caused a fight in the stands: the British attacked the Argentines. After the game, Diego said: "I didn't touch the ball, it was the hand of God."
                    </p>
                    <p>In Italy, at the end of the match, this goal of Maradona was called "Piola's Little Hand", because of the goal scored by Silvio Piola against the British on May 13, 1939. After the goal, the English began to literally "hunt" for Maradona, especially the central defenders Terry Butcher and Terry Fenwick. A few minutes after the first goal, Diego scored a goal, beating 6 consecutive English players: Harry Stevens, Peter Reid, Steve Hodge, Terry Butcher, goalkeeper Peter Shilton and Terry Fenwick. Later, in 2002, this goal was called the best in the history of the World Championships. England manager Bobby Robson said after the game: "It was a fantastic goal." Maradona himself said: "I liked that goal. But it was just one goal. They will not win the championship...". At the end of the game, the English played one goal, and the game ended in favor of Argentina 2:1. Maradona for playing in this match was dubbed "The Michelangelo of football".</p>
                    <p>For us, for the country we represented, the game with England was the final one. We defended not just the honor of the national team, but the honor of the country. Of course, before the match, we said that football had nothing to do with the war for the Malvinas Islands, but we knew a lot of guys who died there, shot like birds. It was revenge. It's like we've recaptured a few islands. In the pre-match interviews, we all said that football and politics should not be interfered with, but this was a lie. We couldn't help but think about it. For us, winning meant more than just winning, reaching the next round and getting England out of the championship. To some extent, we blamed the English players for everything that happened, for all the suffering of the Argentine people. This feeling was stronger than us: we defended the colors of the flag, the dead guys and those who survived. I think that's why my goal meant so much. Actually, both goals. Both had their own charm.</p><div class="thumb tright" style="margin: 0.5em 0px 1.3em 1.4em; width: auto; background-color: #ffffff; clear: right; float: right; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">

                    <p>A year after the World Cup, on August 8, 1987, Maradona participated in the match dedicated to the centenary of the English football League as part of the rest of the world team. For this match, Diego earned 100 thousand pounds. The game was played at Wembley, and when Maradona received the ball, there was a roar of dissatisfaction in the stands. After the game, Maradona said: "I don't blame the audience. What sometimes happened is the result of the unscrupulous work of a number of journalists...". 20 years later, Diego said, " The Hand of God never existed. God really helped us then, but I scored that ball with my hand." 22 years after the goal, Maradona apologized for his actions: "If I could go back in time and change history, I would do it. Right now, I can only apologize for what I did. What happened, happened, Argentina became the world champion, and I became the best football player on the planet."</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Semi-final and final</strong></p>
                    <p>Before the semifinal matches, almost all the newspapers wrote that the winner could be one of two teams: either Argentina, led by Maradona, or France, the European champion, where Michel Platini shone. Before the semi-final game, Maradona said that he hoped that the Belgian defenders would not use illegal techniques against him. The game ended with a score of 2: 0, and Maradona, who became the best player of the meeting, scored both goals of his team, the second of which he scored after a pass, beating 4 players of the Belgian team. Immediately after the final whistle, Belgian goalkeeper Jean-Marie Pfaff quickly ran to the center of the field, where Maradona was, and exchanged shirts with him. Guy Thies, the head coach of the Belgian national team, said: "If Maradona played for our team — we would have reached the final. But you can only dream of such a thing."</p><div class="thumb tright" style="margin: 0.5em 0px 1.3em 1.4em; width: auto; background-color: #ffffff; clear: right; float: right; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">

                    <p>The World Cup final was held, as well as the match with England, at the Azteca Stadium, at an altitude of 2350 meters above sea level. German coach Franz Beckenbauer entrusted the personal care of Maradona to Lothar Matteus, who already brought down his ward 5 times by 21 minutes, and from the penalty earned on the 5th foul, when Matteus was shown a yellow card, the score was opened: Brown scored from Batista's pass. At the beginning of the second half, the Argentines led with the score 2:0 — Valdano scored, completing the attack started by Maradona. The Germans were able to find the strength to equalize the score, twice hitting the goal of Pumpido after corners, but then in the 85th minute, Burruchaga scored, to whom Maradona gave a one-touch pass from the central circle to enter the goal. The game ended with a score of 3: 2, and in a post-match interview, Maradona said that all 11 players won this game, and that he, even with the score 2:2, was confident in the victory of his team. Immediately after the final, the Argentine fans came to Diego's mother and threw flowers at her house, dancing the tango all night under the windows and raising slogans of praise to Maradona and his family. When asked at the celebration of Argentina's victory: "Could Argentina have reached the final without Maradona," Bilardo said:<br>Maradona is an ekstraklasa player, but he is inseparable from the team team. In two aspects, Maradona is unique: in hard work and discipline. He was a constant example to his teammates. He was the first to start training and the last to finish it. He is always calm and patient on the pitch. And most importantly, the captain of the national team of Argentina was surprisingly the most disciplined player in the team. He's a great friend. His relationships with the players, coaches, and staff are impeccable. Maradona is not only a Genius of individual play. His brilliant performances on the field cannot overshadow the brilliant collective actions in the name of the team's interests. Like all great masters, Maradona has a highly developed sense of understanding of partners, a great art of passing. At the same time, even in the most tense moments of matches, when one of the players of the Argentine national team could not play because of fatigue or excitement, Maradona never showed his dissatisfaction with his teammates by a word or a gesture.</p>
                    <p>Jorge Valdano, Maradona's teammate, said: "Do you know why we won in Mexico? Because we had 20 normal players in our team and one abnormal player. This crazy guy won us the championship." Diego himself later said: "Before the start of the 1986 World Cup, the state of the team was disastrous. We didn't lose friendly matches to the strongest clubs. Bilardo gave instructions that no one understood. After his installations, someone else had to translate his words for us. Ask Valdano if you don't believe me. He went out on the pitch and didn't know what he was supposed to do. The same applies to Burruchaga. So it's not Bilardo's fault that Albiceleste won the world title. Everything was done by the players, and I myself played as I saw fit."</p>
                    <p>After returning to Buenos Aires with the national team, Diego met with the President of the country, Raul Alfonsin. The two of them went out on the balcony of the Rose House and greeted the thousands of people who filled May Square. Thanks to his game, Maradona received the "Golden Ball" as the best player of the World Cup (in 1989, the trophy itself was stolen from Diego's home in Naples). He also became the best in the number of assists and the "goal+pass" indicator.</p>

                    <p>in the Summer of 1986 Maradona wanted to buy a new President of the club AC Milan, Silvio Berlusconi, who offered a salary twice what she paid for Napoli, as well as a luxury car, an apartment in the most prestigious area of Milan and a stake in the company Berlusconi, the "Fininvest", but Diego had refused the Rossoneri, peripodial contract with Napoli by raising wages to $ 5 million per year. Also from the president of "Napoli" he was presented with a Ferrari F40 car, at that time the only one in the world. In the same off-season, Italy midfielder Fernando De Napoli joined the Azzurri. In the first round of the 1986/1987 championship, Napoli won Brescia thanks to Maradona's only goal, but in the next round they lost to Udinese, a team that was deprived of 9 points at the start of the tournament for participating in match-fixing. Before the 7th round of the championship, Napoli was in second place in the standings and played away with Roma, the only goal in the match was scored by Maradona, who shot from 10 meters after a pass from Giordano. After this victory, and also thanks to the draw of Juventus, who shared points with Inter ,the Neapolitan club took the first place in Serie A: "This victory took off the psychological burden from us. We felt able to beat any opponent."</p>
                    On November 11, Napoli faced Juventus, the Italian champion and their main pursuer, in Turin, and won 3-1, losing during the match. After this match, the Azzurri became the leaders of the Italian championship. In the penultimate match of the first round, Napoli lost to Fiorentina 2: 3 (Maradona scored the second goal of his team) due to an error in the last minutes of goalkeeper Garella, but in the next match they beat Ascoli and became the winter champion of Serie A. In the middle of the season, the Azzurri experienced a decline that coincided with Maradona's decline in the game: the Argentine could not hit the opponents ' goal for 620 minutes (6 matches). In the 22nd round, in a match with Roma, played in a draw, Maradona suffered a minor injury, which is why he did not train for several days. In the 23rd round, the Neapolitan club lost to Inter 0: 1, and Maradona could not realize a one-on-one exit. Then there was a draw with Empoli and a defeat by Verona, in a match where Maradona, who was playing with an injury, did not score a penalty. However, after the match with Verona, Maradona said: "Right now, after this defeat, I am more confident than ever — the champion will be Napoli! Every team in the championship must have the worst match ever! We played it today. But that won't happen again. And then, we have two points left!"</p>
                    <p>However, the fans continued to express their dissatisfaction. 4 rounds before the finish, Diego reported: "I've realized lately that Naples doesn't love me anymore. Well, if the love runs out, then there will be a divorce." After that, the Neapolitan public was divided: some supported Diego, others reproached him for "childishness". On April 26, Napoli defeated AC Milan (2: 1), the decisive goal was scored by Maradona, this victory almost opened the way for the Neapolitan club to the Scudetto, won two matches later after a draw with Fiorentina. At the end of the season, Maradona extended his contract with the Azzurri for 5 years.</p>

                    In the summer, Napoli played a friendly match at home with the Argentine club Rosario Central and lost 0: 1, and Maradona did not score a penalty 3 minutes before the end of the match, after which he was booed by the Neapolitan tiffosi until the final whistle. After the game, Maradona said:<br>The audience didn't understand. She does not want to show understanding and restraint. The day before yesterday I said: the team is just starting the preparatory stage and the results of the trial games do not matter much. The reaction of the audience caused me bitterness and disappointment. However, since 1989, they will not be able to boo me anymore, because as soon as my contract ends, I will leave here.</p>
                    <p>However, a few days later, the player noted that his opinion was impulsive and hasty, and in the first official game of the season, a huge banner was hung in the stands of Napoli with the inscription: "Maradona! We love you! You are forever ours!" In the same off-season, a new striker, the Brazilian Kareka, came to the club and immediately found mutual understanding on the field with Maradona, these two players, together with the Italian Giordano, formed the famous three of the "MaGiCa" attack (Maradona, Giordano and Careca).</p>
                    <p>After 12 rounds, the club scored 21 points, losing only to Pisa, but in the 13th round, the club was defeated by the main pursuer of the Neapolitans, Milan with a score of 1:4. And in the next match in the Italian Cup, he lost to Fiorentina with a score of 2:3. In the subsequent matches, the Azzurri started to win. In the first 19 rounds, Napoli scored 87 % of the points. Only in the 26th round, the club lost to Juventus, and then drew with Verona. On May 1, "Napoli" met with "Milan", which was 1 point behind the opponent and lost 2: 3, and one of the goals was scored by Maradona with a free kick. And then Diego got injured and did not play in the last matches. "Napoli" finished the championship in 2nd place. However, Diego himself was least blamed: the Argentine became the top scorer of the championship with 15 goals. Despite this, there were accusations in the press that the Neapolitan club "handed over" several games due to pressure from the structures that controlled the sweepstakes, but this was not proven.</p>

                    <p><strong>1988/1989</strong></p>
                    <p>The 1988/1989 season was not very successful for Maradona — he missed several matches due to a knee injury and a back ailment. He made his first appearance in the third round, and with him in the squad, Napoli defeated Pescara with a score of 8: 2, and two of the eight goals were scored by Diego himself. However, even without him, the club, which radically changed the composition, adding players Alemao, Giuliano Giuliani and Luca Fuzi, again took 2nd place, 11 points behind the champion, Inter Milan. In the league, Maradona scored only 9 goals and scored 3 times in the UEFA Cup won by the club, more often playing along with partners than scoring on his own. In the same season, the Neapolitan club reached the final of the Italian Cup, but lost it to Sampdoria with a total score of 1: 4, and Maradona with 7 goals became the top scorer of his team in the tournament.</p>
                    <p>In the middle of the season, Diego's contract was offered to Olympique Marseille, whose president, Bernard Tapie, offered Maradona a salary twice as high as he received at Napoli and a villa with a park of 6,000 square meters. On the eve of the UEFA Cup final, the president of Napoli, Corrado Ferlaino, agreed to let Diego go to Marseille if the club wins this tournament. After winning the tournament, Ferlaino approached Maradona and said: "You're not for sale. I just wanted to motivate you."</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>1989/1990</strong></p>
                    <p>In the 1989/1990 season, Bianchi was replaced by Alberto Bigon as coach of Napoli. Maradona was unable to play at the beginning of the season due to an injury, and Gianfranco Zola took his place in the squad. Without Diego in the squad, the Neapolitan club earned only 1 point in the first three matches. However, the player later recovered from the injury and returned to the squad, which helped the club win the second Scudetto in 5 years. Maradona scored 16 goals in the tournament, becoming the third sniper after Marco van Basten and Roberto Baggio. Zola later recalled that if he had not come into contact with Maradona, he definitely would not have become such a football player later. For the young Gianfranco, Diego played the role of an older brother, from whom he learned a lot.</p>
                    <p>In the same season, the club won the Italian Super Cup, in the final of which Maradona's team beat Juventus 5-1.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>World Cup 1990</strong></p>
                    <p>After winning the World Cup in 1986, the national team of Argentina stopped showing high results. At the 1987 Copa America, the team finished only 4th, despite the performance of Maradona, who, playing with adductor tendinitis, scored 3 of the 5 goals of the national team, including the first goal of the tournament, on June 27 in the 47th minute of the match against Peru. In the list of the best scorers of Maradona, only 1 goal was lost to the best sniper of the Cup, the Colombian Arnoldo Higuaran. In 1989, Argentina took the 3rd place, and Maradona himself, very tired (for the season he played more than 50 games) and had problems with the back of the thigh, did not score a single goal. A few months before the World Cup, Maradona even announced that he would refuse to participate in the world championship if he was not well prepared.</p>

                    <p>
                         <strong>Final Tournament</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         A few days before the tournament, Maradona lost a nail on his right foot. Because of this, he could not run and train. On June 3, at the Dal Monte Institute in Rome, a protective splint made of carbon fiber was applied to Diego's nail. The very next day, Maradona held a full training session.
                    </p>
                    <p>The final tournament of the 1990 World Cup began for Argentina on June 8 with a match against Cameroon at the San Siro Stadium, and in the first game, Argentina lost 0:1. According to Maradona, the reason for the defeat was the fact that Claudio Canigia did not appear in the starting line-up of the national team, and the other forwards of the national team were "unforgettable". Another reason for the defeat, Diego called the rough game of the Cameroonians, especially Benjamin Massing, who acted personally against Maradona. The second match, against the USSR national team, was held in Naples, in the hometown of the club Diego. Argentina won 2-0, and after Oleg Kuznetsov's strike, Maradona knocked the ball off the goal line with his hand, but the referee of the match did not notice the episode. In the third game, also held in Naples, Argentina drew 1-1 with Romania (Diego provided an assist) and exited the group from third place thanks to the higher number of points scored compared to the other third-placed teams in their groups. In the game against Romania, Maradona received a painful blow to the ankle of his left foot, which is why he played in the remaining matches on painkillers.</p>
                    <p>In the 1/8 final, Argentina met with Brazil, which was played by Diego's partners in "Napoli" - Kareka and Alemao. Most of the match, the Brazilians had a huge advantage, and only due to luck and the second Argentine goalkeeper Goicoechea their gates were not touched (repeatedly after the ball strikes the Brazilians had hit the woodwork), but in the 81st minute, Maradona made his signature pass, beating several players of the Brazilian national team, being surrounded by three opponents, Diego could, falling, twisting his leg and give a very accurate pass between the legs of the opponent on Claudio Canigou, which, in turn, scored the winning goal. At the stage of the 1/4 final, Argentina defeated Yugoslavia in a penalty shootout, while Maradona did not score his penalty.</p>
                    <p>In the semifinals, the Argentines faced the hosts of the tournament, the Italians, who had previously won all the matches in the tournament. The game was played in Naples. On the eve of the match, Diego gave an interview in which he said: "I don't like how everyone now calls on Neapolitans to be Italian and support the national team. Naples has always been isolated from the rest of Italy. This city has always suffered from unfair racism." After the interview, the head of Napoli fans, Gennaro Montuori, said: "We will support Italy, while respecting and applauding Argentina." The game itself had posters with the words: "Diego in our hearts, Italy in our songs", "Maradona, Naples loves you, but Italy is our Homeland". The game ended in a 1-1 draw, and the Argentines won the penalty shootout. Maradona scored the winning penalty. After the game, at the team's home base, an unknown person tore down the flag of Argentina, which infuriated Diego.</p>
                    <p>In the final, Argentina lost to the German team with a score of 0: 1 after an undisputed penalty, scored by the Germans. In this game, Maradona was remembered for receiving the last yellow card in the tournament. The reason for the poor performance of Diego in the final was called the game of Lothar Matteus, who personally acted against Maradona. When the match ended, Maradona burst into tears on the pitch. The post-match reward ended in a scandal: Maradona refused to shake the hand of the president of FIFA, Brazilian Joao Avelange, believing that he had deliberately arranged so that the Argentines did not win. For his performance at the World Cup, Diego received the "Bronze Ball" as the third player of the World Cup.</p>
                    <p>On October 11, a few months after the end of the World Cup, Maradona announced:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                         <p>I will no longer play for the national team. I thought about this decision for a long time and made my choice. He hurts me, but I leave the post of captain in my favorite team, but I have to do it. I was lied to, I was pushed out of the team. Joao Avelange was treated like a king during his visit to Argentina, as if nothing had happened. To top it all off, Julio Grondona wrote a letter to Viola, the president of Roma, thanking us for the way he treated us, and for who knows what else. I mean, Ruggieri, Giusti brown — we're all idiots?! They didn't even notice how badly we were treated in Italy! Grondon is the vice-president of FIFA, but when we were robbed of the victory in the final, he did not lift a finger! Despite all the pain of this decision, despite the fact that I really like being the captain of the national team, I'm leaving.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p><strong>1990/1991</strong></p>
                    <p>After the 1990 World Cup, Maradona fired his agent Guillermo Coppola and appointed a new one, Marcos Franchi. The football season started positively — "Napoli" won the Italian Super Cup. After that, Maradona played another 24 games, in which he scored 10 goals. In the Champions League, the Neapolitan team played poorly, losing to Spartak Moscow; at the same time, Diego did not arrive with the team for the decisive return game, but a day later on a private plane. On March 17, 1991, after the match of the 25th round of the Italian championship with Bari, won 1-0, the player was selected among the players who must pass a doping test. The test revealed the presence of cocaine in Diego's system. The Italian Football Federation has decided to disqualify Maradona for a period of 15 months. The lawyers tried to challenge the disqualification, but the appeals committee upheld the decision. On March 24, a few days before his suspension, Maradona played his last game for Napoli: his club lost 1-4 to Sampdoria»; the only goal of the Neapolitans was scored by Diego from the penalty spot.</p>
                    <p>According to Maradona, the tests were tampered with thanks to the intervention of the president of the Italian Football Federation, Antonio Mattarrese, who avenged Diego for the defeat of the Italian national team against Argentina at the 1990 World Cup. Maradona himself claimed that although he took drugs, he always conducted doping tests on his own, so that on the eve of the games there was no trace of the drugs taken in his body.</p>
                    On April 1, Maradona decided to return to Argentina, saying that he wanted to devote all his time to his family, and that he was tired of football. On April 26, at Diego's house on Franklin Street in the Caballito district, Maradona and two of his friends were arrested for drug possession: 36 grams of cocaine were found in his possession. The next day, after paying a bail of 20,000 pesos, Maradona was released from custody. Prior to the trial, Judge Amelia Berras de Vidal ordered Diego to undergo rehabilitation. According to Diego, the entire detention procedure was staged by the Argentine authorities. In September 1991, Maradona was sentenced in absentia in Italy to 14 months of probation for cocaine found in the basement of his home.</p>
                    <p>During the rehabilitation process, which was supposed to help Diego get rid of a long-term addiction (he first tried drugs while playing for Barcelona), Maradona decided to participate in various charity matches. On August 3, 1991, Diego played a match in favor of the Fernandez Hospital. He was supposed to play in a match dedicated to the memory of Juan Hilberto Funes, a football player who died on January 11; at the moment of death, Maradona was with him. However, on April 15, FIFA sent a fax to AFA President Julio Grondone, in which it did not approve of the possibility of Maradona playing in the match and indicated that for his participation, other players may be subject to some sanctions, according to the current rules. However, the players who took part in this game made a unanimous decision on the presence of Diego on the field, for which the referees who are not members of the AFA were invited to serve the match, and the organization itself, thus, withdrew from the organization of the match. On FIFA's conduct, Maradona said: "No one in Argentina will cry for Blatter, Avelange and other officials after their deaths." On February 27, 1992, Maradona played a match, all the fees from which went to disabled children. In the city of Posadas, Diego played a game, the fees from which went to the local hospital. Maradona also played mini-football in the TV program "Rhythms of the Night".</p>

                    <p>
                         On July 1, 1992, Maradona's 15-month suspension ended. "Napoli" wanted to see the player again in their squad, but Diego wanted to leave Italy and play in a club that would not set itself big tasks in tournaments. He said :" My time at Napoli is definitely over and the Neapolitans are not likely to be so happy about my return." And after the arrival of the head coach of the team, Claudio Ranieri, who said that while he was coaching Napoli, Maradona would not come to Naples even as a tourist, Diego was determined to leave the team. There were talks about Maradona's transfer to Sevilla or Olympique Marseille. As a result, the case was decided in favor of the Spanish club, which was the first to offer $ 7.5 million for the transfer of the forward. On 22 September, Maradona became a Sevilla player. Maradona moved to Sevilla, largely thanks to the club's head coach, Carlos Bilardo, who was very eager to see Diego in his team. The president of Sevilla said: "I understood that Maradona is not the same and is not in the best shape, but I invited him for the sake of the fans. And even though it cost a lot of money, I considered myself the happiest of people. A dream came true — Maradona played in my team."

                    <p><strong>«Newells Old Boys»</strong></p>
                    In 1993, Maradona returned to Argentine football, signing a contract with Newell's Old Boys on September 9. Initially, he wanted to return to Argentinos Juniors, but after threats from the club's fans demanding to pay 50 thousand dollars, Diego chose to move to a more relaxed Rosario. On September 13, 1993, Maradona's first training session as a member of the Red and Black team was held; more than 40 thousand people gathered there. On 10 October, he made his debut for the club in a match against Independiente, in which his club lost 1-3; Diego scored the only goal of his team, hitting the goal with a heel kick. On December 2, 1993, in a match against Uracan, Maradona suffered a small muscle tear in his left leg, which was why he was released from training for 2 weeks. During Diego's absence, Newells coach Jorge Raul Solari, who had invited Maradona, was fired. His place was taken by Jorge Castelli, whose relationship with Diego did not work out. The reason for this was the agreement of the football player with Solari, to which Castelli did not agree. Maradona's last match for the club was against Vasco da Gama on 26 January 1994. On February 1, the player's contract with the club was terminated. In total, Diego played 5 official matches for the "Lepers".</p>
                    On February 2, 1994, Maradona attacked journalists and photojournalists who were reporting outside his home in Moreno with an air rifle. For this, he was sentenced to 2 years of probation, and was forced to compensate the moral and physical damage to the injured journalists.</p>

                    <p><strong>Qualifying Matches</strong></p>
                    <p>After his return to football, Maradona played only 2 matches for the national team of Argentina. Head coach Alfio Basile did not trust Diego, who did not play a single match in the qualifying tournament for the 1994 World Cup, playing only in friendly matches. Without him, the Argentine team performed poorly. After a 0-5 loss to Colombia, Basile, on 23 September 1993, officially asked Maradona to return to the national team, which was preparing for the decisive matches of the qualifying stage with Australia. With the help of Maradona, who made an assist in the first game, Argentina won with a total score of 2: 1 and qualified for the final tournament. 18 years after these two meetings, Diego said that at the behest of the President of the football Association of Argentina Julio Grondona, on the eve of the second game the players were given a special coffee containing doping, after which they "ran a lot more"; moreover, Grondona was able to do so after the meeting was not held a doping test.</p>
                    <p>At the preparatory matches, Maradona again got into trouble: Japan, where the national team flew to a friendly game, refused Diego a visa because of his drug problems. On 20 April, in a friendly match against Morocco, Maradona scored a goal for the national team, for the first time since 21 May 1990.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p> <strong>Final Tournament</strong></p>
                    <p>The first game of the national team of Argentina in the final tournament of the World Championship was held on June 21 with Greece. In it, the Argentines won with a score of 4: 0, and Maradona, playing "in the wall" with Fernando Redondo, scored in this game his last goal at the World Championships. After the game he said: "I dedicate this match to the skeptics who claimed that I am no longer capable of anything. I'd like to hear what they're saying today." The second game Argentina won again, winning Nigeria with a score of 2:1, with the decisive goal was scored from a pass from Maradona. After the game, Diego passed a doping test. Before the last group game against Bulgaria, Maradona was informed that he had tested positive for 5 substances: ephedrine, norephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norpsevdoephedrine and methylephedrine. Maradona's suspension was 15 months.</p>
                    Without Diego, Argentina lost their two remaining matches. After the Bulgaria game, Redondo told Maradona: "I was looking for you, I was looking for you on the pitch and I couldn't find you… I've been looking for you all match." Regarding doping, Diego said that these substances were in his flu medicine and nasal drops, which his personal doctor, Daniel Serrini, bought for him in the United States, and that he did not take the banned drugs himself. After the disqualification, Diego uttered his famous phrase: "My legs were cut off." The match against Nigeria in Boston was Maradona's last match in the national team of Argentina. In total, he played 91 matches and scored 34 goals in the national team shirt.</p>

                    </p>
                    Maradona was disqualified for 15 months, until September 15, 1995. The suspension only applied to Diego's football performances, so he began looking for a club where he could show his administrative skills. On 3 October 1994, Maradona was appointed, along with Carlos Fresn, head coach of the club "Mandiu". In his debut match under the leadership of Diego, "Mandiu" lost to the club "Rosario Central" with a score of 1: 2; while Diego himself managed the club from the box of honor due to the fact that at that time he did not have a coaching license. Two months into the job, Osvaldo Cruz, one of the club's owners, came into the locker room and insulted the players. Maradona dismissed him, saying that only the coaches could be in the locker room. Cruz asked him: "Who are you?" After that, Diego beat Cruz and submitted his resignation on December 6. During Maradona's tenure, the club held 12 meetings, of which it won one, drew 6 and lost 5. The best result of the club in that period was a draw with River Plate. Immediately after his dismissal from the "Mandiu", Maradona replaced his representative Marcos Franchi with Guillermo Coppola, with whom he had already worked for several years before. On January 6, 1995, Maradona and Fren were hired by Racing from Avellaneda. In this club, Diego worked for 4 months, with him "Racing" played 11 matches, of which he won two, drew 6 and lost 3.

                    <p><strong>Boca Juniors</strong></p>
                    <p>After an unsuccessful coaching debut, Maradona expressed a desire to start working as a playing coach of the club "Boca Juniors". But against this there were two circumstances: the first — the head coach of the club was Silvio Marsolini, whom the club's management did not want to dismiss, the second — the "Genoese" could not give Maradona the salary to which he was accustomed during his performances. Both of these circumstances were resolved by Diego himself: he refused to try to move to the position of coach of the team, and also agreed that his salary would be paid by several businessmen-fans of Boca, led by Eduardo Eurnekian. Maradona preferred the contract with Boca to the contract with the Brazilian "Santos", where he was invited by Pele, who offered Diego the position of playing coach. Also, the management of the club went to meet Diego and, at his request, bought Claudio Canigia. After signing the contract, Maradona started working hard to get in shape. At the same time, he starred in a small role in the film "El día que Maradona conoció a Gardel". Also on September 18, 1995, Maradona organized the "International Association of Professional Footballers" in Paris, which included Eric Cantona, George Weah, Gianluca Vialli, Gianfranco Zola, Laurent Blanc, Thomas Brolin, Rai, Ciro Ferrara and Michel Prudhomme.</p>
                    <p>
                         Maradona's official return to football took place on September 30 in Seoul, where Boca Juniors faced South Korea and won 2-1. The same week, Maradona held a conference at Oxford University, telling students about his life and the newly formed association of professional football players. On 15 October 1995, Maradona scored his first goal after being disqualified, bringing the Genoese a 1-0 win over his former team, Argentinos Juniors. Boca had a poor first Opening after Maradona's return: the club finished only 4th, and Diego scored only 3 goals in 11 games. At the same time, he missed some of the matches due to injury, and in the absence of Diego, the club scored only 1 point out of 12 possible. It wasn't until Maradona returned to action that Boquita started to win. As a result of an unsuccessful performance in the club, both the president and the coach were replaced. Despite this, Maradona expressed a desire to return to the national team of Argentina, for which he had previously refused to play, because " the people are asking for it." He was also supported by the President of Argentina, Carlos Menem. In 1996, the team's management decided to appoint Carlos Bilardo, Maradona's former coach in the national team, as head coach. Initially, Maradona threatened to leave the club if it was headed by Bilardo, but then supported the mentor. In the same season, a new president, Mauricio Macri, came to the club, with whom Diego had several run-ins, including a public altercation on the radio. In the Apertura, Boca Juniors took the 5th place, and in the overall table — the 4th position. Maradona himself did not demonstrate a high level of play this season: he played 13 matches and scored 2 goals, and in the game with Racing he did not score a penalty, which became the 5th consecutive unrealized 11-meter shot. He said: "I am destroyed... I want to die." After that, Diego played another match, on August 11 with Estudiantes ,and then he refused to play for the club. He hasn't been on the field for 11 months. In August, having already completed his performances, Maradona was acquitted by a court after accusations that he had switched his jar of urine with a jar of Alberto Vargas, who was found to have doped.
                         In the summer of 1996, Guillermo Coppola reported that the player had signed a contract worth $ 20 million with a Japanese club, but the deal did not take place due to the country's legislation prohibiting entry to any person convicted of possession, use or transportation of narcotic drugs.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the same year, Maradona was an active participant in the "Sunshine without Drugs" campaign organized by the Government of Argentina: "I did it for the kids. Drugs are everywhere, and I don't want them to take over children." In August 1996, Maradona went to Switzerland, to the Bellele clinic, where he wanted to undergo treatment for cocaine addiction: "I want to be completely cleansed of this evil. I have to do this for my daughters. The hospital in Switzerland was recommended to me by a friend of mine. It is more expensive to be treated in Argentina: doctors only demand money and do not bring any benefit." Diego spent 10 days there. After that, Maradona returned to his homeland, on the way where he participated in an exhibition game in Canada.</p>
                    <p>In the fall of 1996, Maradona created a foundation to financially support Boca Juniors. In October, 500 grams of cocaine were found in Maradona's home. In December, Maradona expressed his desire to replace Carlos Bilardo as coach of the "Genoese". Also on December 29, he took part in a charity game, all funds from which went to the paralyzed player Pablo Forlan. In January 1997, Diego held talks with the club "Barcelona" (Guayaquil), where he was going to perform the role of playing coach. In the same month, he said that he would probably play for the Uruguayan "Peñarol". However, the club from Montevideo rejected the idea of inviting the Argentine.</p>
                    <p>
                         In February 1997, Diego opened a chain of restaurants catering chain "Maradona Sports Cafes". On April 7, 1997, Diego was admitted to the hospital due to very high blood pressure, which rose during his participation in the Chilean television program "Viva el Lunes" (Live on Monday) on Canal 13.
                         On April 22, 1997, Maradona signed a new contract with Boca Juniors, despite having refused to renew it a few months earlier. In order to get in shape, Diego hired the famous track and field athlete Ben Johnson as a coach, who was paid $ 1,000 a day. On 9 July, Maradona took the field for the first time after a long break in a friendly match against Newells Old Boys and scored a goal with a free kick. On July 13, Diego appeared in an official game for the first time after a long break, in which Boca defeated Racing 3-2, and Diego participated in all three of his team's goals. This match started with a 20-minute delay due to press photographers who did not want to leave the field to take pictures of Diego. In July, a strike of professional football players in Argentina began, which Diego not only did not support, but also called "idiotic", apologizing on behalf of all the players of the national championship. In the same season, Maradona insisted on buying Boka Martin Palermo, who later became the top scorer in the team's history.

                    <p>On August 24, he played in the match in which Boquita defeated Argentinos Juniors 4:2, and Diego himself, having converted a penalty, scored the 150th goal in the Argentine championship. After that game, Maradona passed a doping test that tested positive for methylecgonine and benzoylecgonine, the metabolites of cocaine. He was disqualified until re-analysis, which, later, also gave a positive result. In June, Diego went to the police, claiming that he himself did not take anything and was deliberately poisoned. Moreover, a month before the match, in which doping was discovered, Maradona began to receive calls threatening to" plant " drugs on him. Later, Diego swore to his daughters that he did not take doping. Judge Claudio Bonadio confirmed that such threats against Maradona had taken place, and decided not to impose sanctions against Diego, up to the DNA test that gave a positive result of tests. He also ordered Maradona to be tested for doping after each match.
                    <p>Despite the fact that Maradona was given permission to perform, he was unable to perform for a month due to an injury sustained in the Super Cup Libertadores game with Colo-Colo. Diego returned to the field on October 25, 1997, in a game in which Boca defeated its principal rival, River Plate, with a score of 2:1. In this game, Maradona was replaced after the break by Juan Riquelme, having suffered a recurrence of the injury. This match was the last for Maradona, held at the professional level. On October 30, his 37th birthday, Maradona announced his retirement.</p>

                         Maradona had excellent technique, used various non-football techniques: throwing, throwing, rolling the ball, which he did at a very high speed, thanks to which he circled many opponents. Also, Diego had a very accurate pass and a great left-foot shot from the game and from the penalty area, which he trained since childhood. At the same time, Diego could shoot from any position and score goals for every taste.
                    </p>
                    <p>Maradona had a very good vision of the field, thanks to which he could make assists for strikers in the club and the national team. He stood out for his focus on the fight: even if he lost the ball, he "took care" of the opponent until the ball returned to his team.</p>
                    <p>Also, Diego was extremely stable on the field and well-developed leg muscles, which allowed him to stay in a standing position after hitting his legs. It was also distinguished by the coordination of the body.</p>
                    <p>Maradona's technique was the prototype for the dribbling of Ronaldinho, who was "crazy about everything he did".</p>
                    <p>According to Arrigo Sacchi, thanks to Diego, all the teams in which he played, began to play football at a much higher level.</p>

                    <p>In February 1998, Maradona participated in an exhibition match of the club "Kareka", which was created by his former partner at "Napoli". In March 1998, having already finished his football career, Maradona received an offer to sign a contract with the club "Newells Old Boys", which was coached by his friend Sergio Batista. However, Diego refused due to financial problems with his illegitimate son. The Paraguayan Olimpia also hoped to get Maradona into their squad. Having finally finished his career as a player, Maradona took up other activities, working as a sports commentator, in particular, he commented on the matches of the 1998 World Cup for the Tele America channel, vice-president of the Commission of the Boca Juniors club and an expert in sports programs. This stage of his life was marred by health problems related to drug use. At the same time, Diego sought a cure for drug addiction, visiting clinics in Argentina and Cuba.
                    <p>
                         In the summer of 1998, Maradona held talks with the English club "Crystal Palace", applying for the post of coach of the team. In the same year, he held talks with the Spanish club "Badajoz".

                         In February 1999, Maradona promised Diego Latorre that he would beat him, after the footballer showed an indecent gesture to fans of Boca Juniors, for which he played. In December 1999, Maradona became an adviser to the Libyan national team, refusing to lead the team alone. In September 2000, Maradona published the book "Yo soy el Diego "("I am Diego"), in which he reviewed his entire biography and career, as well as confessed to the origins of his drug addiction.<div class="thumb tright" style="margin: 0.5em 0px 1.3em 1.4em; width: auto; background-color: #ffffff; clear: right; float: right; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">

                                        Maradona in the Showbol match

                    <p>In January 2000, Maradona was placed in the Cantegril sanatorium while in the Uruguayan city of Punta del Este, where he was having a party in the company of a drug dealer. He was admitted to the hospital with a hypertensive crisis and cardiac arrhythmia. His representative, Guillermo Coppola, said that it was not due to drugs, but because of nervous overexertion. However, traces of cocaine were found in his blood and urine, for which Diego was brought before the Uruguayan justice. Since no drugs were found in his possession, no charges were filed. After leaving the clinic on January 18, Diego left for Cuba, settling in a closed clinic in El Kinke, 700 km from Havana, where he spent a course of treatment and rehabilitation.</p>
                    <p>On November 10, 2001, Maradona, for the first time after a long break, appeared on the field participating in the match of the national team of Argentina and the world team, which included Enzo Francescoli, Eric Cantona, Davor Shuker, Juan Roman Riquelme, Carlos Valderrama, Rene Igita and other players. This match was a farewell for Diego, who played 1 half for the national team, and the second for the world team. The game ended in favor of Argentina 6: 3, and Maradona scored 2 goals. After the game, he uttered one of his most famous phrases: "I made a mistake and paid for the mistake. But you can't get the ball dirty!" In honor of Diego, the number 10 was permanently removed from the national team's number rotation. FIFA later changed this decision. In the same year, he signed a contract to participate in the exhibition game of veterans and artists in Moscow, but violated the terms of the contract and did not come to the game.</p>
                    <p>In 2002, Diego again commented on the World Cup matches for the Mexican channel Televisia and the multinational Direct TV. The Japanese leadership even lifted the ban on the entry of Diego. In the summer of 2002, Diego released a CD, the main hit on which was called "The Hand of God", all proceeds from which went to the hospital for destitute children of Pedro Elisalde.</p>
                    <p>In April 2004, Maradona was again admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of a heart attack. His heart problems were aggravated by his increased weight and drug addiction, which is why, after being discharged from the hospital, he was placed in a clinic on May 9, where he underwent a course of detoxification. When Diego was cured he said: "I remember in one movie — "Heaven can wait" - a man dies, finds himself in a tunnel, but there begins to protest, believing that his death hour has not yet come. That's the tunnel I've been in. And I saw in it the fans of "River Plate", "San Lorenzo", "Racing", "Uracan", "Independiente"...". After 3 months, Maradona asked the court to give him the opportunity to move to Cuba. This was due to the fact that Diego could not leave the hospital without the consent of the family exercising custody of him, according to the court decision. In addition, Elena Bortiri, the lawyer of the Maradona family, used article 152 of the Argentine Civil Code, and partially deprived Diego of legal capacity because of his drug addiction; according to this article, the family had to become the guardian of the drug addict and take care of the person. Diego was forced to turn to the country's president, Nestor Kirchner, to help him fly to Cuba. Due to the fact that his request was not fulfilled, Maradona continued the course of treatment at home. In December 2004, Maradona, who was late for a plane, organized a pogrom with friends in the VIP lounge of the Rio de Janeiro airport.</p><div class="thumb tright" style="margin: 0.5em 0px 1.3em 1.4em; width: auto; background-color: #ffffff; clear: right; float: right; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">

                    <p>Due to the long stay in the hospital, Maradona gained a lot of weight: by February 2005, he weighed about 120 kg. In March of the same year, in a clinic in the city of Cartagena, he was given a brace that reduces the capacity of the stomach and eliminates part of the small intestine from the digestive process. Thanks to the operation and a strict diet, Maradona lost more than 50 kg in a few months.
                    <p>In the summer of 2005, Maradona was invited to host the talk show "Night of Ten" on Channel 13. Diego hosted the first broadcast on August 15. For this program, Maradona invited Pele. The program also featured several interviews, including Cuban leader Fidel Castro and world chess champion Anatoly Karpov, who played live chess with Diego. On November 7, the last program was held; the boxer Mike Tyson was a participant. The TV program won the 2005 Clarín Espectáculos awards as "Best Entertainment Program"; Diego received the award as "Person of the Year". In addition, Maradona participated in a dance program for the Italian RAI channel, which he refused due to long-standing problems with Italian law and the need to fly to Italy twice a week.</p>
                    <p>From June 22, 2005 to August 26, 2006, Maradona served as Vice-President of the Boca Juniors Club Board. One of his actions was lobbying for the post of head coach of the team Alfio Basile. Maradona also played in the veteran team "Boca" and charity matches Soccer Aid, which was a tournament on a variation of mini-football Showbol. In the summer of 2006, Maradona again worked as a TV commentator, commenting on the matches of the World Cup, working for the Telefe channel.</p>
                    <p>On March 17, 2007, many Argentine media reported the death of Maradona, allegedly killed in a car accident, but the information was not confirmed.</p>
                    <p>On March 28, 2007, Maradona was placed in the Guemes Clinic, due to excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages. He was diagnosed with severe intoxication. He was in the clinic until April 11. According to another version, Diego was treated for hepatitis caused by alcohol consumption. Two days after discharge, Diego had a relapse, and he was hospitalized Mother Teresa de Calcutta in the province Ezeiza with very low blood pressure and pain in the region of the stomach. He was later transferred to the Sanitarium de los Arcos in Buenos Aires, where he was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver. Diego stayed there until April 21, when he decided to go to the Avril psychiatric clinic. After two weeks in the clinic, he was released from the hospital on May 6. At the same time, while Diego was in Avril, rumors began to spread about his death.</p>
                    <p>In September 2008, Maradona was offered the post of representative of Inter Milan in South America, but it did not come to a real contract.</p>

                    <p>On October 17, 2008, after Alfio Basile resigned for personal reasons, Maradona again expressed his desire to lead the national team of Argentina. On October 28, he met with Julio Grondona, the president of the Argentine football association, where he was offered the leadership of the national team. On November 4, Maradona officially became the coach of the national team. His assistants were Carlos Bilardo, who officially held the post of technical director, Pedro Troll, Sergio Batista and Alejandro Mancuso, who were directly involved in the training of the team, as well as Fernando Signorini, who was engaged in the physical training of the team at the World Championships in 1986 and 1990. The tactics for the matches were developed by Maradona himself and Hector Enrique, Diego's partner in the 1986 national team. Maradona's first decision as coach of the national team was the appointment of Javier Mascherano as captain.</p>

                    <p>Alfio Basile's son, Alfito, has claimed that Diego conspired against his father to remove him from the national team. According to him, Maradona met with the players of the national team of Argentina, promising them a place in the national team if he was appointed: "These meetings took place almost before every match of the national team. This senior met with the players of the national team and told them that he would be their next coach. Therefore, he is a conspirator." Maradona denied all the accusations: "Everything Alfito said is far from reality. That's not my style. My approval and my criticism of the national team has always been public. And I always wanted the national team to play well. I know Alfito, we've spoken to each other a couple of times, and I can understand that he said all these things because he was very upset that his father lost his job. A place that is very important for all of us who love football in Argentina. But there's no way I can accept what he's talking about. He disappointed me, saddened me. And it hurts, it really hurts for me." The captain of the national team, Javier Mascherano, said he did not see a plot against Basile.</p>

                         The first match under the leadership of Diego Argentina was held on November 19 against Scotland, winning it 1-0. On February 12, 2009, Argentina played with the French national team, the vice-world champion, and won 2-0. On March 28, Albicelesta held the first official match under the leadership of Maradona, in which the Argentines defeated Venezuela with a score of 4:0. On April 1, Argentina unexpectedly lost 1-6 to Bolivia; after the game, Diego said :" Every goal of the Bolivians is a thorn in my heart. Before the game, I would never have thought that such a defeat was possible." In the next few matches, the team did not look very good, Diego attributed this to a lack of motivation. After these games, Maradona decided to change the composition of the national team.

                         On June 26, 2009, Diego signed a contract with the national team until 2011, before that he worked for free, according to him, he receives 139,000 euros per month (according to other sources, 110,000 dollars per month). On September 6, Argentina lost to Brazil with a score of 1: 3, and then lost to Paraguay. On October 15, after defeating Uruguay, Argentina advanced to the World Cup final. After the game, Diego said:<br>I remember well that there were those who did not believe in our team. There are many who did not believe in us. I apologize to the ladies present, but these detractors have sucked and will continue to suck. Black or white, I will never be gray in my life. Suck it-I'm talking to them the way they talked to me.
                    </p>
                    <p>Upon this statement, the FIFA commission conducted an investigation, after which Diego was disqualified for 2 months and fined 25 thousand Swiss francs. Because of his words, Diego missed the draw ceremony for the final stage of the World Cup, as the disqualification extended to official FIFA events.</p>
                    <p>In May 2010, Maradona criticized the Argentine Football Association and its president, Julio Grondona, for canceling a friendly match against the UAE national team. To this accusation, Grondona's son, Umberto, said that for his father he was "ready to trample anyone".</p>

                    <p>the match against Bolivia, from which the Argentines lost with the score 1:6, Diego aroused in Juan román Riquelme, however, in an interview with Canal 13, announced that he was leaving the national team due to personal conflicts with Maradona and different views on football; Diego said that does not understand the actions Riquelme, and that he had no conflict with the player. A few months later, a campaign was launched in the country to attract Riquelme to the national team, but Diego said that the player would not be in the national team, despite the fact that he had previously expressed his readiness to return Juan Roman to the national team if he apologized to him. Riquelme said again that the national team has no future with Maradona in charge, but wished him good luck.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                         <p>It is not true that I made statements that were offensive to Maradona. I'm not such a fool as to miss the World Cup because of some statements. This question is on a completely different plane. I repeat again that I will never work with Maradona, because I will never be able to give up my own essence.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>There is a version that the reason for the conflict was the negative attitude of the national team team to Juan Roman. And Maradona in this dispute sided with other players of the national team.</p>

                         <strong>World Cup 2010</strong>
                    </p>
                    On May 12, 2010, Maradona announced the preliminary squad of the team that will take part in the World Cup. The team's list did not include players who were regularly called up to the Albicelesta squad by previous national team coaches: Esteban Cambiasso and Javier Sanetti, saying that they are "an old story for the national team, and the team needs a new one". Diego noted that when compiling the list of players who went to the World Cup, he was extremely objective. On May 19, Maradona announced the final list of players who will take part in the World Cup. The reason for the non-recall of these players was called that they decomposed the atmosphere of camaraderie in the national team, having a great influence on the team of the national team.
                    </p>
                    <p>Maradona's former national team partner, Osvaldo Ardiles, criticized Diego for not including Cambiasso, Sanetti and Riquelme in the squad for the tournament and for not having a nominal right-back. He said that Maradona and his assistant in the national team, Carlos Bilardo, are in a state of conflict, seeking to get rid of each other. Ardiles also expressed the opinion that Maradona in making decisions about the composition and tactics for the game is guided solely by an internal voice.</p>
                    <p>Before the start of the tournament, Maradona said that he believes in this team more than in the one that won the World Cup in 1986 and expressed confidence that the players, like Diego himself, "are ready to die on the field for the sake of the Argentina national team shirt." Maradona also promised, if the national team wins, to run naked around the Obelisk in Buenos Aires. During the tournament, Maradona allowed the national team players to have sex and drink a glass of wine a day.</p>
                    <p>At the first stage of the World Cup finals, Argentina was placed in Group B, along with the teams of Nigeria, South Korea and Greece. In the first match, against Nigeria, Argentina achieved a 1-0 victory, demonstrating a good game in attack and problems in the team's defense. After the game, Diego said: "I wish I had a crystal ball, and then I could be a wizard, but I'm not a wizard, I'm just a coach. There is a lot to improve in our game to play seven matches. Of course, winning the first match at the World Cup calms you down, and you calmly continue to prepare for the next match. There is no place for fear in football. If you are afraid of something, then stay at home." In the second match of the tournament, Argentina beat South Korea 4-1; forward Gonzalo Higuain scored three goals in the game, becoming the third player in the history of the national team to score a hat-trick at the World Championships. In the third game, Argentina defeated Greece with a score of 2: 0, reaching the 1/8 finals of the tournament from the first place.</p>
                    <p>In the 1/8 final, Argentina defeated the national team of Mexico with a score of 3: 1, with the first goal of the match being scored by the Argentines from an obvious offside position. Diego himself said that his team deserved to win. One of the innovations in this match in the game of the Argentines was the inclusion in the starting line-up of Nicolas Otamendi, who replaced the right-back Jonas Gutierrez, who had previously played in all the previous matches of the national team in the tournament and acted unsuccessfully, due to a weak game in defensive actions. After the match, Clarin reported that several players of the national team are dissatisfied with the fact that they are given little playing time, but Maradona replied that relations in the national team are still excellent. On June 30, Maradona said: "I feel like I put on the national team jersey and go out on the field. It's great to coach such a group of players. I am proud to share these moments with them. They said about me that I have no idea how to train. All of a sudden, I found myself winning matches and still being the same."</p>
                    <p>On the eve of the 1/4 final, in which Argentina met Germany, Diego promised: "A minute before the quarterfinal match starts, I will tell the players that they must leave their lives on the field. That behind them — the whole country, which deserves happy moments. That it depends on them whether the whole of Argentina wakes up the next morning with a smile on its lips — or whether it will cry. In our country, people are addicted to football. Our victories can help these people overcome the most difficult moments in their lives, " Maradona also said that he has no doubts about the outcome of his team's match with Germany. In the game itself, the Argentines were defeated with a score of 0: 4 and were eliminated from the tournament. This defeat was the biggest for the national team of Argentina at the World Championships in 36 years. After the match, Maradona said: "If I retire tomorrow, I want these players to continue playing in the same style. I'm proud of my players. Whoever comes to this post will have to follow my path. I noticed that people like this kind of football, this team always strives to play and be ahead of the opponents. As for the possible departure, I have to think about it. We need to talk about this with the family, the players, the federation. There are many nuances. The result of the match against Germany does not reflect what happened on the field. The Germans used their chances, but we didn't. We gave the ball to the Germans and they took their chances well. We played well, but we didn't have enough freshness for a breakthrough." Maradona also said that he is not going to review the match with Germany, trying to evaluate the performance of the national team at the end of the entire tournament, and not a single game.</p>
                    <p>After the team's departure from the tournament, Maradona said: "I'm disappointed. It's hard to return to your homeland after this. We need to talk it over with the guys. The opponent scored, but we could not, although we had chances. We couldn't afford to lose with such a big score. I survived our relegation in the semi-finals in 1982, but I was young then. Now I'm almost 50 years old, and this is the most difficult time of my life. It's like a punch in the face. I don't have the energy to do anything else." Despite this statement, Julio Grondona asked Maradona to remain the head coach of the national team until August 11. Upon the arrival of the team in Buenos Aires, the fans who met them rewarded the players with applause, and Diego with requests to stay in the national team. On July 5, Diego said: "Yes, my time in this team is over. I gave her everything I could." On July 26, Maradona announced that he would remain in the national team only if his entire coaching staff also retained their posts. On July 27, Maradona left the post of head coach of the national team. The reason for this was the refusal of the leadership of the Argentine Football Federation to allow Diego's assistants to keep their positions, in particular, the president of the federation, Julio Grondona, demanded to dismiss Alejandro Mancuso; at the same time, the leadership of the Argentine football wanted to keep Maradona as the head coach of the national team, offering him a contract for 4 years. Grondona said he and Diego "couldn't come to a common denominator."</p>
                    <p>After leaving the national team, Diego said:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                         <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Grondona tricked me, and Bilardo betrayed me. In South Africa, we had a meeting with Grondona, a few players and other people. Grondona told me then that he was happy with my work and wanted me to stay in my post. Then he met me in Argentina and told me that seven people from my staff should leave their posts. But it was the same as if he had asked me to leave myself. They wanted to fire my people, but I didn't even discuss it. I have my own code of honor, which my father taught me. I'm not going to betray you.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    To these accusations, Grondona replied that Maradona had misinterpreted his words.</p>

                    <p>After leaving the Argentina national team, Maradona wanted to continue his coaching career. He expected to take the post of head coach of the Portuguese national team or the English club "Aston Villa". In September 2010, Diego wanted to return to the post of head coach of the national team, even agreeing to fire his assistants. According to a survey by Clarin and La Nacion magazines, more than 90 % of the respondents were against the return of Diego to the post of head coach of the national team.</p>
                    <p>Diego also regularly participated in charity events. On September 29, 2010, he visited Moscow, where he presented Hublot watches; there he participated in a competition, all the prize money from which, 500 thousand dollars, went to create the first Russian register of bone marrow donors to help children suffering from cancer, created by the Raisa Gorbacheva Institute of Pediatric Hematology and Transplantology: "I was happy to accept the invitation. I really wanted to win more money, because I understand how sick children need it. I am a grandfather myself, and I understand that children are our future, I really wanted to help them, I hope I managed to do something." On October 16, Diego organized a charity match between the national teams of veterans of Uruguay and Argentina, all the fees from which went to the treatment of a former player of the national team of Argentina, Fernando Caceres, who was seriously injured as a result of an armed gang attack.</p>
                    <p>In December 2010, Maradona became a candidate for the post of head coach of Blackburn Rovers, as well as the Iranian national team; however, Diego did not accept both teams. To continue his coaching career, in February 2011, Maradona signed a contract with the agency company of Jorge Mendes, dealing with the affairs of famous figures from the football world. In April 2011, Maradona became a candidate for the post of head coach of the club "San Lorenzo".</p>

                    <p>In May, Diego reached an agreement to work for him in the Emirati club "Al-Wasl". On May 17, Maradona signed a contract with this team for two years with a salary of 3.5 million euros per season. On August 29, he made his debut as head coach of this club in a friendly match against Al-Ittihad, in which his team won 3-1. On September 22, before the match with the Emirates, Diego kicked a fan who was trying to raise a banner prepared by his granddaughter. The Argentine later apologized for his behavior. On October 8, Al-Wasl lost 0-5 to Dubai in the UAE Cup. In the same month, the coach was accused by the club's president of not being able to conduct transfer affairs; Maradona, in turn, said that he asked to strengthen the squad with new players, which was not done. He also said of his club: "Al-Wasl lacks professionalism. Some players are students, others are police officers. There are also football players who are military personnel. As a result, many players come to training tired and can't work properly. In addition, not everyone can attend the training sessions. Sometimes I have 16 and sometimes 24 players at my disposal." On December 13, Maradona was fined $ 2,700 and suspended for 3 games for a conflict after a match with the head coach of Al-Wasla's rival team, Al-Ain Club; Diego was unhappy with the way Cosmin Olaru, the head coach of the rival team, celebrated the victory over his club. Also, the Al-Wasla stadium was suspended for 2 games, after which Diego accused the UAE Football Federation of being biased against his team.</p>
                    <p>In September 2011, Maradona said that former national team player Carlos McAllister offered Diego bribes to take players to the national team. Maradona also said that Carlos had agreed with Batista and Jose Luis Brown that if they took charge of the national team, they would take the players recommended by McCallister for money. Brown said of the accusation: "My love for Maradona has turned into compassion. Diego is the best football player in the world, but you can't turn a blind eye to this. Let him produce the evidence. If this is really the case, then I will leave the country." Batista promised to apply for Maradona to the court, which he did in November.</p>
                    <p>On January 14, 2012, Maradona was hospitalized with kidney stones. The next day, he was operated on.</p>
                    <p>In February 2012, Diego said that he was persona non grata at home in Argentina due to the fact that he did not support the top sports officials in the country; he also stated that he would one day lead Boca Juniors. In the same month, he said that if Al-Wasl did not provide funds for the purchase of new players, he would leave the post of coach of the team. In March, Diego had a fight with fans from the VIP stand of Al-Wasla's rival, Al-Shebab, who insulted Maradona's girlfriend, Veronica Ojeda.</p>
                    <p>In April 2012, Diego had a conflict with the management of the club due to the fact that the players promised to him were not acquired. On July 11, 2012, the management of Al-Wasl dismissed the Argentine from the post of head coach. As it was reported on the official page of the team in the microblog on Twitter, this decision was made on Tuesday, July 10, at a meeting of the club's board. The reason for Maradona's dismissal was that during the season, Al-Wasl not only failed to win any awards, but also dropped from sixth to eighth place in the national championship, despite the fact that 12 teams play in it.</p>
                    <p>In July 2013, Maradona underwent surgery to correct age-related presbyopia.</p>
                    <p>On May 8, 2017, Maradona took charge of the Al-Fujairah club. On 27 April 2018, Maradona resigned as head coach of the Arab club after the team failed to qualify for the UAE First Division. The parties terminated the contract by mutual agreement before the end of the championship. The team would not have been able to rise above third place. However, on April 30, it was reported that the parties still agreed to extend the contract for a year. As a result, the club's management refused to cooperate with the Argentine specialist after his lawyer requested a 4-fold increase in salary.</p>
                    <p>On May 15, Maradona became the president of Dinamo Brest. The contract with the club was for three years. The Argentine had to deal with the strategic development of the club, as well as interact with all its structural divisions, including the children's academy. However, since July, Maradona has not come to Belarus.</p>
                    <p>On September 6, he headed the Mexican club "Dorados de Sinaloa". The Argentine also became the technical director of the club. This was announced on Twitter by the club, which plays in the second division of the Mexican championship. The contract is for 11 months. During this time, Diego will earn about $ 2 million. There is an automatic extension clause in the contract if the club can reach the top division.</p>

                    <p> <strong>Drugs</strong></p>
                    <p>According to Maradona himself, the drugs affected all of his abilities, except for his memory.</p>
                    <p>For the first time, Diego tried drugs while playing for Barcelona. He used them to make himself feel good in an unfamiliar environment: "At first I felt an emotional shock: everything around me became very bright, cheerful, entertaining. Wonderful sensations, which, unfortunately, did not last long. And then I felt the need to start it again and again, and I didn't know how to get out of it." Taking drugs was accompanied by long-term depression in Diego, as well as periods of aggression towards people close to him: "I remember with horror how my daughters came to me with a request to play with them, and I could not, because I was high. Under the eternal high. I think if it wasn't for my wife, I wouldn't be in this world right now. It's a debt I'll never pay off." At the same time, for him, drugs were not doping, did not improve his physical condition.</p>
                    <p>Addiction to drugs, according to the mother of his illegitimate child, Christiana Sinagra, was due to the fact that Maradona had a fine mental organization and a very fragile psyche. According to some, the main reason for the addiction to drugs was a close relationship with his agent, Guillermo Coppola, who was accused of drug trafficking and supplied Diego with cocaine. According to Maradona, in May 2004, he finally stopped using drugs.</p>
